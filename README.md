# OpenBB Platform Game

## Description

As part of the OpenBB Internal Hackathon, we created a game that allows users to get introduced to the OpenBB Platform. The goal of the game was to delve into the installation and features of the Platform, from the different menus, their commands, and their usage. We have designed it to provide hands-on experience and deepen the understanding of financial data analysis.

Note: This is a proof of concept and is very simple and unpolished. If there is interest, we can develop it further.

## Play the Game

To play the game, make sure you install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the game by executing the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
